# MPU9250 Project

This project allows to test a MPU9250 with a PSoC device. The [MPU9250](https://www.invensense.com/products/motion-tracking/9-axis/mpu-9250/) is a nine-axis inertial
measurement unit. I2C protocol can be used to configure the device, and to retrieve
data from it. In this project you can find a library with functions required to 
interact with the device.
